    Changes the gender of the input audio using Praat's 'Change gender' algorithm.

    Args:
        input (np.ndarray): The input audio data as a NumPy array.
        sampling_rate (int): The sampling rate of the input audio.
        pitch_min (float): Minimum pitch (Hz) below which pitch candidates will not be considered.
        pitch_max (float): Maximum pitch (Hz) above which pitch candidates will be ignored.
        formant_shift_ratio (float): Ratio determining the frequencies of formants in the newly created audio.
            A ratio of 1.0 indicates no frequency shift, while 1.1 approximates female formant characteristics.
            A ratio of 1/1.1 approximates male formant characteristics.
        new_pitch_median (float): Median pitch (Hz) of the new audio. The pitch values in the new audio
            are calculated by multiplying them by new_pitch_median / old_pitch_median.
            Default: 0.0 (same as original).
        pitch_range_factor (float): Scaling factor for the new pitch values around the new pitch median.
            A factor of 1.0 implies no additional pitch modification (except for the median adjustment).
            A factor of 0.0 monotonizes the new sound to the new pitch median.
            Default: 1.0.
        duration_factor (float): Factor by which the sound will be lengthened.
            Values less than 1.0 result in a shorter sound, while values larger than 3.0 are not supported.
            Default: 1.0.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The processed audio data as a NumPy array with the gender changed.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If pitch_min is greater than pitch_max or if duration_factor is larger than 3.0.
